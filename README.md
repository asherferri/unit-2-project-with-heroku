### Initial thoughts on app structure

- Seeding a database with API info (still figuring out how to).
- Show in an intuitive way the info scouted.
- Easy to use inviting design.
- If time permits a space news row.
- Auth if brain doesn't fries.
- Deployment to heroku is obscure.

### Final thoughts on app structure

- The user seeds the database as needed
- Show in an intuitive way the info scouted.
- Easy to use design.
- CRUD functional on Launches and Users.
- Auth functional.
- Succesfully deployed to heroku.
